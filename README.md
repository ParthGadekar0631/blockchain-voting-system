# Blockchain Voting System 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Blockchain-based Voting System** using **Solidity**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**. The system aims to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized voting process by leveraging blockchain technology. It ensures tamper-proof vote storage and real-time voting results, enhancing trust in digital elections.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Blockchain Integration:** Uses Ethereum blockchain for decentralized voting.
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity for handling election logic and vote casting.
- **Web Interface:** User-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Voters can view vote counts instantly after casting their votes.
- **Security & Transparency:** Votes are immutable and visible on the blockchain for full transparency.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Solidity** (Smart Contracts)
- **JavaScript** (Frontend & Blockchain Interaction)
- **HTML & CSS** (Web Interface)
- **Web3.js** (Blockchain Integration)
- **Truffle** (Development Framework)
- **Bootstrap** (Responsive Design)

## 📊 How It Works
1. **Load the App**: Open the frontend on your browser.
2. **Admin Setup**: Admin can create elections and add candidates using smart contracts.
3. **Voting Process**: Voters can cast their votes for the candidates of their choice.
4. **Blockchain Verification**: Votes are recorded and verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain.
5. **Real-Time Results**: The system displays live updates of vote counts.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
